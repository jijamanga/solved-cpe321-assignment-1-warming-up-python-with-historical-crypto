The objectives for this lab assignment are as follows:

<ul>

 <li>To crack classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenère, and mono-alphabetic substitution cipher);</li>

</ul>

<strong>Programming Tools:</strong> Python

Requirements

Please read the requirements carefully, and finish the lab assignment accordingly:

<ul>

 <li>Implement these classical ciphers using Phyton. Along with the built-in Python functions you may only use the math and string libraries.</li>

 <li>Do not use any other libraries, online tools, cracking programs, or code you did not write.</li>

 <li>In the tarred file <strong>tar.gz</strong> you will find 9 files. Each of these files has been encrypted with a historic cipher. You need to decrypt them.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Questions</h1>

<ol>

 <li>What are the advantage and disadvantage of these classical cipher?</li>

 <li>Will you consider using these classical ciphers for your content protection?</li>

</ol>

Why or why not?

<ol start="3">

 <li>Discuss your experience during the crack implementations.</li>

</ol>

<h1>In Your Report</h1>

Please address the following in your report:

<ul>

 <li>Describe Caesar, Vigenère, and mono-alphabetic substitution cipher;</li>

 <li>Describe how to implement the encryption and save the output files;</li>

 <li>Describe the crack implementation: o File name; o Key and which cipher;

  <ul>

   <li>For Caesar the encryption key should be a number between 0 and 25 (assume A=0, B=1, C=2 and so on);</li>

   <li>For Vigerene the encryption key should be a word</li>

   <li>For the mono alphabetic the key should be a 26-character string o Decrypted text – spaces must be inserted; o Process used to decrypt the file – this should be a simple description of the process you used to crack the cipher, referencing any code you wrote;</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>

o Code you wrote to decrypt the file (you must use at least some code for each task)

<ul>

 <li>Show the demo: screen shot of the result and code</li>

 <li>Answer the questions and attach your source code</li>

</ul>

<strong>Useful algorithms: </strong>You may want to consider implementing the following algorithms to help with decrypting the files

<ol>

 <li>A Caesar Cipher decryption algorithm;</li>

 <li>A Vigerene decryption algorithm;</li>

 <li>A mono-alphabetic substitution decryption algorithm;</li>

 <li>Letter frequency counter;</li>

 <li>Chi-squared test;</li>

 <li>Index of coincidence;</li>

 <li>Digraph frequency count;</li>

 <li>Repeat analysis to determine Vigerene key length.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Helpful hints: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Some files have space removed;</li>

 <li>The input texts for files include English texts;</li>

 <li>At least one input text includes scientific names;</li>

 <li>Vigerene ciphers have key lengths of 5, 9, and 13;</li>

 <li>At least one is a proper noun;</li>

 <li>At least one is a sentence without spaces;</li>

 <li>Some English text does not follow normal frequency distribution</li>

</ol>
